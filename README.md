# Enhancer_transcript_identification_from_read_to_visualization
This page shares "Enhancer_transcript_identification_from_read_to_visualization", a beginner-friendly pipeline for genome-wide identification and quantification of enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) using GRO-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq data.

This pipeline was designed as:
1. An example analysis workflow that can be directly run in a terminal to reproduce results using publicly available datasets.
2. An eRNA quantification analysis pipeline, written entirely in Shell script and organized step-by-step.

Its modular and easy-to-follow structure makes it suitable for bioinformatics beginners who want to
1. Learn how to identify enhancers from raw sequencing data, including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and nascent RNA-seq (e.g., GRO-seq).
2. Understand the logic behind enhancer classification, validation, and strand-aware eRNA quantification.
3. Customize and build their own pipelines for enhancer analysis and transcriptional profiling in research projects.
